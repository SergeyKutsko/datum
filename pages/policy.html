<p><strong><span style="color:red">Mistakes</span></strong>.
Zerocrat may sometimes make mistakes, which may lead to missed payments,
incorrect calculations of your reputation, broken communications,
corrupted data and so on. We may not guarantee its stability during the
beta-testing period. We will <strong>NOT</strong> be able to cover any losses that
may occur because of Zerocrat&#39;s mistakes.</p>

<h2>Developer (<a name="DEV">DEV</a>)</h2>

<p>You can talk to Zerocrat in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slack: <a href="https://www.0crat.com/add_to_slack">start</a> a private conversation with <code>@0crat</code></li>
<li>Telegram: <a href="https://telegram.me/zerocrat_bot">start</a> a chat with <a href="https://telegram.me/zerocrat_bot"><code>@zerocrat_bot</code></a></li>

</ul>

<p><a name="1" href="#1">§1</a>
&quot;Invite.&quot;
To start working with us you have to be invited by someone we already know,
whose <a href="#18">reputation</a> is over 1024.
Ask that person to say <code>invite</code> with your GitHub login to Zerocrat.
The person will be your mentor and will be responsible for helping you
out in the system. Also, the mentor will receive financial bonuses from
us for the money you earn.
Join this <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A">Telegram chat</a> if you don&#39;t know anyone yet.
Once you are invited, your name and your performance metrics will be visible in the <a href="https://www.0crat.com/gang">Gang page</a>.</p>

<p><a name="2" href="#2">§2</a>
&quot;Apply.&quot;
To join a project you have to find it on the <a href="https://www.0crat.com/board">Board</a>
and send <code>apply</code> request to Zerocrat. The architect of the project will
either invite you or ignore your request. You can apply multiple times,
even to the project you already are a member of, for example, to request
a raise of your <a href="#13">project rate</a>.</p>

<p><a name="33" href="#33">§33</a>
&quot;Sandbox.&quot;
You can <a href="#2">apply</a> to a project only if your <a href="#18">reputation</a> is over 256.
If it is lower, you can only apply to sandbox projects
(<a href="https://www.0crat.com/p/C63314D6Z">Cactoos</a>,
<a href="https://www.0crat.com/p/C7JGJ00DP">jPeek</a>,
and <a href="https://www.0crat.com/p/C3T46CUJJ">PDD</a>)
and your highest allowed rate is $16.
You can&#39;t apply to a sandbox project if your reputation is over 1024.
You will be automatically removed from a sandbox project once your reputation is over 1024.</p>

<p><a name="3" href="#3">§3</a>
&quot;Election.&quot;
Zerocrat may assign a job to you according to its own election rules, if you have <code>DEV</code> role
and are not on <a href="#38">vacation</a>.
You will be notified in job&#39;s ticket. The rules include, in order of importance:</p>

<ul>
<li>The highest <a href="#18">reputation</a> wins</li>
<li>Lowest <a href="#16">project rate</a> wins</li>
<li>Shortest average <a href="#26">job completion time</a> wins</li>
<li>The emptiest agenda wins, but the maximum allowed size of agenda
depends on your <a href="#18">reputation</a>:
3 jobs if less than 512 points,
8 if less than 2048,
16 if less than 4096, 24 otherwise.</li>
<li>The size of agenda doesn&#39;t matter if the job is a code review.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="4" href="#4">§4</a>
&quot;Fixed Budget.&quot;
Each job has a fixed budget in minutes,
which will be multiplied by your hourly rate and paid to you when the job is completed.
The actual amount of time you spend on the job doesn&#39;t affect the amount of money you receive.
You will also get as many positive <a href="#18">points</a> as many minutes you are paid for.</p>

<p><a name="18" href="#18">§18</a>
&quot;Points of Reputation.&quot;
You may earn positive and negative points for doing good and bad things in
the projects. They do not affect your cash income, but do affect the impression Zerocrat
has about you&mdash;the more points you have the more disciplined developer you are.
Zerocrat takes into account only the points you earned over the last 90 days.</p>

<p><a name="5" href="#5">§5</a>
&quot;Boost Factor.&quot;
A job may receive a boost factor, which will increase or decrease its budget.
Default boost factor is <code>2x</code>, which means 30 minutes.
Default boost factor for a code review is <code>1x</code>.
In exceptional situations, you should ask project architect to boost your job.</p>

<p><a name="6" href="#6">§6</a>
&quot;Refusal.&quot;
You may refuse to complete any job by saying <code>refuse</code>.
You will get 15 negative <a href="#18">points</a> for that.</p>

<p><a name="7" href="#7">§7</a>
&quot;Definition of Done.&quot;
A job is completed when its ticket is <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html">closed</a>.</p>

<p><a name="8" href="#8">§8</a>
&quot;Ten Days.&quot;
If you don&#39;t complete a job in 10 days Zerocrat <em>may</em> take it away from you.
You will get no money and 30 negative <a href="#18">points</a> if this happens.</p>

<p><a name="29" href="#29">§29</a>
&quot;Pay per Bug.&quot;
Each time you report a new <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2018/02/06/where-to-find-more-bugs.html">bug</a>
that becomes a job, you earn 15 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="9" href="#9">§9</a>
&quot;Impediments.&quot;
You may declare impediments for a job by saying <code>waiting</code> to Zerocrat.
Until the job has impediments <a href="#8">Ten Days rule</a>
is not applicable to it.</p>

<p><a name="36" href="#36">§36</a>
&quot;Speed Bonus.&quot;
Zerocracy measures the time interval between the moment
a job is assigned to you and the moment it goes out of scope.
If this interval is shorter than 4 hours, you get extra 10 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="16" href="#16">§16</a>
&quot;Rate.&quot;
To make money in any project you must define your hourly rate.
To do that just say <code>rate</code> to Zerocrat. This rate is for marketing purpose
only, since each project will <a href="#13">set</a> their own rates for you.
Your rate can only be between $16 and $256.
You can use USD, EUR, GBP, or JPY, but all payments will be made in USD.</p>

<p><a name="20" href="#20">§20</a>
&quot;Wallet.&quot;
We can send you money either via PayPal <del>or Bitcoin</del>.
To tell us how exactly you want to receive them just say <code>wallet</code> to Zerocrat.</p>

<p><a name="32" href="#32">§32</a>
&quot;Job Status.&quot;
You can always check status of any job, just say <code>status</code> to Zerocrat in the job ticket.</p>

<p><a name="40" href="#40">§40</a>
&quot;Reply to RFP.&quot;
If your <a href="#18">reputation</a> is over 2048, you will see new <a href="https://www.0crat.com/rfps">requests for proposal</a>.
You can &quot;pay&quot; 256 points for an email address of any RFP, contact them directly,
and bring them to Zerocrat; to do that just say <code>rfp</code> to Zerocrat.
Remember, you are <a href="http://datum.zerocracy.com/pages/terms.html#non-solicitation">not allowed</a>
to work with them without Zerocrat.</p>

<p><a name="38" href="#38">§38</a>
&quot;Vacation.&quot;
You can always &quot;go on vacation&quot; if you want Zerocrat to temporarily stop
assigning you new jobs; just say <code>vacation</code>.</p>

<p><a name="35" href="#35">§35</a>
&quot;Quit.&quot;
You can always quit a project, just say <code>quit</code> to Zerocrat.
You will still have to finish the jobs assigned to you in the project.</p>

<p><a name="39" href="#39">§39</a>
&quot;GitHub name change.&quot;
If you <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username/">change</a>
your GitHub name, your Zerocrat account will be lost.
You will have to create a new one from scratch.</p>

<h2>Code Reviewer (<a name="REV">REV</a>)</h2>

<p><a name="27" href="#27">§27</a>
&quot;Code Reviews.&quot;
You will be asked to review pull requests if you have <code>REV</code> role assigned.
Be as critical as you can, as <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/09/serious-code-reviewer.html">this article</a> explains.
Either you accept or reject the changes, inform the architect, right in the ticket&mdash;the
architect will either merge the pull request or close it.
In either case you will be paid 15 minutes.</p>

<h2>Product Owner (<a name="PO"/>PO</a>)</h2>

<p><a name="41" href="#41">§41</a>
&quot;Submit RFP.&quot;
The best way to recruit Zerocrat and develop your project with us is to
find and hire an architect&mdash;one of our <a href="https://www.0crat.com/gang">best developers</a>.
You have to fill out <a href="https://www.0crat.com/rfp">the form</a>,
pay non-refundable $16, and wait until one of them <a href="#40">replies</a>.
The RFP will expire and automatically disappear in 32 days.
You can submit a new RFP only when the first one expires or is purchased.</p>

<p><a name="11" href="#11">§11</a>
&quot;Add to Slack.&quot;
To start working with us, you have to <a href="https://www.0crat.com/add_to_slack">invite</a>
Zerocrat to your Slack.</p>

<p><a name="12" href="#12">§12</a>
&quot;Bootstrap.&quot;
To let Zerocrat manage your project you have to create a new Slack
channel and add <code>@0crat</code> to it. Then, you should say <code>bootstrap</code> to Zerocrat.</p>

<p><a name="13" href="#13">§13</a>
&quot;Assign/Resign.&quot;
Everybody who will be managed by Zerocrat must have roles in the project.
To assign a role you say <code>assign</code>. To remove a role you say <code>resign</code>.
By default, all new people you assign are supposed to work for free. If you
want to pay them for the jobs they complete, add hourly rate to the <code>assign</code>
command, for example: <code>assign DEV yegor256 $50</code>. To change the hourly
rate of a person just assign the same role with a different rate, or <code>0</code>
in order to make them work for free.</p>

<p><a name="34" href="#34">§34</a>
&quot;Mandatory Roles.&quot;
A project must always have one PO and one ARC.
A project may not have more than two ARCs or more than two POs.
ARC and REV roles can&#39;t be assigned to the same person.</p>

<p><a name="17" href="#17">§17</a>
&quot;Connect GitHub.&quot;
To connect your GitHub repository to the project you should
1) add a new Webhook: <code>http://p.rehttp.net/https://www.0crat.com/ghook</code>
(with &quot;send me everything&quot; option),
and
2) link the project in Slack: <code>links add github yegor256/cactoos</code>, where
instead of <code>yegor256/cactoos</code> you should put the coordinates of your GitHub repository.</p>

<p><a name="21" href="#21">§21</a>
&quot;Project funds.&quot;
You can add funds to the project by VISA or MasterCard via <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>
at the project web page. Fund will be used to pay programmers for job
completion and to pay Zerocracy management <a href="#23">fee</a>.</p>

<p><a name="22" href="#22">§22</a>
&quot;Refunds.&quot;
All unused funds will be returned to you immediately per your request by
<a href="mailto:refund@zerocracy.com">email</a>.</p>

<p><a name="23" href="#23">§23</a>
&quot;Management fee.&quot;
Zerocracy charges a fixed management fee of USD 4.00 per each successfully
completed job. If your project is not <a href="#17">linked</a> to any private GitHub repositories
this fee is waived.</p>

<p><a name="24" href="#24">§24</a>
&quot;Pause/Activate.&quot;
To put Zerocrat on hold and make a project completely inactive, say <code>pause</code>. To return
the project back to life say <code>pause off</code>.</p>

<p><a name="25" href="#25">§25</a>
&quot;Destroy.&quot;
To completely delete all project files from our servers and terminate the
project say <code>destroy</code> and then <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201898668-Remove-someone-from-a-channel">kick off</a>
<code>@0crat</code> from Slack channel. There is no way back. We highly recommend to use
<a href="#24">pause/activate option</a>.</p>

<p><a name="26" href="#26">§26</a>
&quot;Publish.&quot;
To attract programmers to your project, you can publish it on the
<a href="https://www.0crat.com/board">Board</a>; just say <code>publish on</code> to Zerocrat in order to do it.
When your project is published, its statistical information will be visible in the Web.
You can unpublish it any time, just say <code>publish off</code>.</p>

<p><a name="37" href="#37">§37</a>
&quot;Vesting.&quot;
On top of <a href="#13">cash</a> you can give equity to project contributors.
Just modify the rates in <code>vesting.xml</code> and they will
<a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2018/02/13/micro-vesting.html">automatically</a> start
earning project equity after each job <a href="#7">completion</a>.</p>

<h2>Architect (<a name="ARC">ARC</a>)</h2>

<p><a name="14" href="#14">§14</a>
&quot;Scope In/Out.&quot;
You should add jobs to the scope, by saying <code>in</code> to Zerocrat (or assigning the ticket to him).
You can remove a job from the scope by saying <code>out</code>.</p>

<p><a name="15" href="#15">§15</a>
&quot;Boosting.&quot;
You can increase a budget of the job by setting its boost factor.
Just say <code>boost 2x</code> (or <code>3x</code>, <code>5x</code>, etc.) to Zerocrat.
This operation is against our principles of <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">micro-budgeting</a>,
that&#39;s why you get -10 <a href="#18">points</a> every time you do this.</p>

<p><a name="19" href="#19">§19</a>
&quot;Assign.&quot;
You can manually assign any job to a user, just say <code>assign @yegor256</code>
(where instead of <code>@yegor256</code> you put the GitHub login of the user) or
assign the ticket to that user in your ticket tracking system.
This operation is against our principles of automated task management,
that&#39;s why you will get -5 <a href="#18">points</a> every time you do this.
If you assign a job to its reporter/creator, you will get an additional penalty of -15 <a href="#18">points</a>.</p>

<p><a name="28" href="#28">§28</a>
&quot;Architect Review Bonus.&quot;
You will earn 10 minutes for each pull request successfully merged.
It is recommended to use <a href="http://www.rultor.com">Rultor</a> or a similar
solution, which will allow only the architect to merge.</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance (<a name="QA">QA</a>)</h2>

<p><a name="30" href="#30">§30</a>
&quot;Quality Review.&quot;
If you have <code>QA</code> role in the project, you will be asked to review jobs after their completion.
You have to review the job for its quality and report to Zerocrat: <code>quality is good</code>
(or <code>bad</code>, or <code>acceptable</code>).
You will be paid 15 minutes for the review, no matter what is your verdict.</p>

<p><a name="31" href="#31">§31</a>
&quot;QA Bonus.&quot;
Job performer will get an extra 5 minutes if QA reports <code>good</code> quality.
If the quality is <code>bad</code>, there will be no payment to the job performer at all.</p>

<p><a name="42" href="#42">§42</a>
&quot;QA Rules.&quot;
The quality of a job is `good&#39; if all of the following requirements are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The formatting of a job description, as well as all messages inside it,
follows <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">Github Markdown</a> style.</li>
<li>Messages in a job
<a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html#4-avoid-noiseaddress-your-comments">always</a>
start with a name of a user they are addressed to.</li>
<li>The job is closed only when the reported problem is solved,
<a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/12/top-down-design.html">see</a>.</li>
<li>Some of ticket messages must mention all pull requests where the problem was actually fixed.</li>
<li>Problem reporter and problem solver are two different persons,
<a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html#1.-keep-it-one-on-one">see</a>.</li>
<li>Ticket title and description clearly state what is broken and what kind of fix is expected,
<a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html#5.-report-when-it-is-broken">see</a>.</li>
<li>The ticket describes one specific problem and provides a single solution.</li>
<li>Pull request title explains the problem it is fixing.</li>
<li>Pull request description explains the solution proposed and
contains a link to the original ticket it is related to.</li>
<li>The code reviewer found at least three problems in the code.</li>
<li>Comments were mostly about design problems, not cosmetic issues.</li>
<li>All problems found by the code reviewer were addressed by
the pull request author.</li>
