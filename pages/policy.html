To start working with us you have to be invited by someone we already know.
Ask that person to say <code>invite</code> with your GitHub login to Zerocrat.
The person will be your mentor and will be responsible for helping you
out in the system. Also, the mentor will receive financial bonuses from
us for the money you earn.
Join this <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A">Telegram chat</a> if you don&#39;t know anyone yet.</p>

<p><a name="2" href="#2">§2</a>.
&quot;Apply.&quot;
To join a project you have to find it on the <a href="http://www.0crat.com/board">board</a>
and send <code>apply</code> request to Zerocrat. The architect of the project will
either invite you or ignore your request. You can apply multiple times.</p>

<p><a name="3" href="#3">§3</a>.
&quot;Election.&quot;
Zerocrat may assign a job to you according to its own election rules, if you have <code>DEV</code> role.
You will be notified in job&#39;s ticket.</p>

<p><a name="4" href="#4">§4</a>.
&quot;Fixed Budget.&quot;
Each job has a fixed budget in minutes,
which will be multiplied by your hourly rate and paid to you when the job is completed.
The actual amount of time you spend on the job doesn&#39;t affect the amount of money you receive.
You will also get as many positive <a href="#18">points</a> as many minutes you are paid for.</p>

<p><a name="18" href="#18">§18</a>.
&quot;Points.&quot;
You may earn positive and negative points for doing good and bad things in
the projects. They do not affect your cash income, but do affect the impression Zerocrat
has about you&mdash;the more points you have the more disciplined developer you are.
Zerocrat takes into account only the points you earned over the last 90 days.</p>

<p><a name="5" href="#5">§5</a>.
&quot;Boost Factor.&quot;
A job may receive a boost factor, which will increase or decrease its budget.
Default boost factor is <code>2x</code>, which means 30 minutes.
Default boost factor for a code review is <code>1x</code>.
In exceptional situations, you should ask project architect to boost your job.</p>

<p><a name="6" href="#6">§6</a>.
&quot;Refusal.&quot;
You may refuse to complete any job by saying <code>refuse</code>.
You will get 15 negative <a href="#18">points</a> for that.</p>

<p><a name="7" href="#7">§7</a>.
&quot;Definition of Done.&quot;
A job is completed when its ticket is <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html">closed</a>.</p>

<p><a name="8" href="#8">§8</a>.
&quot;Ten Days.&quot;
If you don&#39;t complete a job in 10 days Zerocrat <em>may</em> take it away from you.
You will get no money and 30 negative <a href="#18">points</a> if this happens.
This rule is not applicable to code reviewing jobs.</p>

<p><a name="29" href="#29">§29</a>.
&quot;Pay per Bug.&quot;

want to pay them for the jobs they complete, add hourly rate to the <code>assign</code>

rate of a person just assign the same role with a different rate, or <code>0</code>
in order to make them work for free.</p>

<p><a name="17" href="#17">§17</a>.
&quot;Connect GitHub.&quot;
To connect your GitHub repository to the project you should
1) add a new Webhook: <code>http://p.rehttp.net/http://www.0crat.com/ghook</code>
(with &quot;send me everything&quot; option),
and
2) link the project in Slack: <code>links add github yegor256/cactoos</code>, where
instead of <code>yegor256/cactoos</code> you should put the coordinates of your GitHub repository.</p>

<p><a name="21" href="#21">§21</a>.
&quot;Project funds.&quot;
You can add funds to the project by VISA or MasterCard via <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>

<p><a name="22" href="#22">§22</a>.
&quot;Refunds.&quot;
All unused funds will be returned to you immediately per your request by
<a href="mailto:refund@zerocracy.com">email</a>.</p>

<p><a name="23" href="#23">§23</a>.
&quot;Management fee.&quot;

it back to life say <code>pause off</code>.</p>

<p><a name="25" href="#25">§25</a>.
&quot;Destroy.&quot;

project say <code>destroy</code> and then <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201898668-Remove-someone-from-a-channel">kick off</a>
<code>@0crat</code> from Slack channel. There is no way back. We highly recommend to use
<a href="#24">pause/activate option</a>.</p>

<p><a name="26" href="#26">§26</a>.

You should add jobs to the scope, by saying <code>in</code> to Zerocrat (or assigning the ticket to him).
You can remove a job from the scope by saying <code>out</code>.</p>

<p><a name="15" href="#15">§15</a>.
&quot;Boosting.&quot;
You can increase a budget of the job by setting its boost factor.
Just say <code>boost 2x</code> (or <code>3x</code>, <code>5x</code>, etc.) to Zerocrat.
This operation is against our principles of <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">micro-tasking</a>,
that&#39;s why you get -10 <a href="#18">points</a> every time you do this.</p>

<p><a name="19" href="#19">§19</a>.
&quot;Assign.&quot;
You can manually assign any job to a user, just say <code>assign @yegor256</code>
(where instead of <code>@yegor256</code> you put the GitHub login of the user) or
assign the ticket to that user in your ticket tracking system.
This operation is against our principles of automated task management,
that&#39;s why you will get -5 <a href="#18">points</a> every time you do this.
If you assign a job to its reporter/creator, you will get an additional penalty of -15 <a href="#18">points</a>.</p>

<p><a name="28" href="#28">§28</a>.
&quot;Architect Review Bonus.&quot;

solution, which will allow only the architect to merge.</p>

<p><a name="QA"/></p>

<h2>Quality Assurance (QA)</h2>

<p><a name="30" href="#30">§30</a>.
&quot;Quality Review.&quot;
If you have <code>QA</code> role in the project, you will be asked to review jobs after their completion.
You have to review the job for its quality and report to Zerocrat: <code>quality is good</code>
(or <code>bad</code>, or <code>acceptable</code>).
You will be paid 15 minutes for the review, no matter what is your verdict.</p>

<p><a name="31" href="#31">§31</a>.
&quot;QA Bonus.&quot;
Job performer will get an extra 5 minutes if QA reports <code>good</code> quality.
If the quality is <code>bad</code>, there will be no payment to the job performer.</p>
