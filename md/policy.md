§1.
"Election."
Zerocrat may assign a job to you according to its own election rules.
You will be notified in its ticket.

§2.
"Fixed Budget."
Each job has a fixed budget in minutes,
which will be multiplied by your hourly rate and paid to you
when the job is completed. The actual amount of time you spent
on the job doesn't affect the amount of money you receive. You will
also get as many positive points as many minutes you are paid for.

§3.
"Boost Factor."
A job may receive a boost factor, which will increase or decrease
its budget. Default boost factor is `2x`, which means 30 minutes.
You should ask project architect to boost a job.

§4.
"Refusal."
You may refuse to complete any job by saying `refuse`.
You will get 15 negative points for that.

§5.
"Definition of Done."
A job is completed when its ticket is closed.

§6.
"Ten Days."
If you don't complete a job in 10 days Zerocrat _may_ take it away from you.
You will get no money and 30 negative points if this happens.

§7.
"Impediments."
You may declare impediments for a job by saing `waiting` to Zerocrat.
Until the job has impediments "Ten Days" rule is not applicable to it.
